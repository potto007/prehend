# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/)-format Architecture
Decision Records for **prehend** (the patched RLM/SRLM orchestrator with an
experience-memory layer; renamed `lm-repl` -> `mnemex` per ADR-0006, then
`mnemex` -> `prehend` per ADR-0007 - older ADR titles keep the name they were
accepted under). Each ADR captures one
hard-won, non-obvious choice so it is found once and reversed only with evidence. New decisions get the next number; accepted ADRs are immutable (to
change course, write a new ADR and mark the old one `superseded by ADR-NNNN`).

Cross-repo references are written `<repo> ADR-NNNN`. The cross-repo master index
lives in [rlm-trainer `docs/decisions/README.md`](https://github.com/ClearBridgeRIP/rlm-trainer/tree/main/docs/decisions).
