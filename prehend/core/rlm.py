            depth: The current depth of the RLM (0-indexed).
            max_depth: The maximum depth of recursion. When depth >= max_depth, falls back to plain LM completion.
            max_iterations: The maximum number of iterations of the RLM.
            max_budget: Maximum budget in USD. Execution stops if exceeded. Requires cost-tracking backend (e.g., OpenRouter).
            max_timeout: Maximum execution time in seconds. Execution stops if exceeded, returning best answer if available.
            max_tokens: Maximum total tokens (input + output). Execution stops if exceeded, returning best answer if available.
            max_errors: Maximum consecutive errors before stopping. Execution stops if exceeded, returning best answer if available.

            logger: The logger to use for the RLM.
            verbose: Whether to print verbose output in rich to console.
            persistent: If True, reuse the environment across completion() calls for multi-turn conversations.
            custom_tools: Dict of custom functions/tools available in the REPL. Keys are function names,
                values are callable functions. These are injected into the REPL globals.
            custom_sub_tools: Dict of custom tools for sub-agents (llm_query calls). If None, inherits
                from custom_tools. Pass an empty dict {} to disable tools for sub-agents.
            compaction: If True, keep full root model history in REPL variable `history` and compact
                when root context reaches compaction_threshold_pct of the model's context limit.
            compaction_threshold_pct: When compaction is on, trigger summarization when root
                message token count reaches this fraction of the model context limit (default 0.85).
            max_concurrent_subcalls: Maximum number of parallel threads for rlm_query_batched subcalls.
                Each child RLM runs in its own thread. Default 4.
            subcall_max_tokens: Generation cap (max_tokens) applied to every llm_query /
                llm_query_batched sub-call. Bounds runaway generations on greedy local models.
                Root orchestrator calls are not capped. None (default) leaves sub-calls uncapped.
                Requires a backend whose completion() accepts max_tokens (openai backend does).
            subcall_max_timeout: Wall-clock cap in seconds on each rlm_query /
                rlm_query_batched child RLM. The child gets min(parent's remaining
                max_timeout, this cap), so a single delegated child cannot consume
                the parent's entire remaining budget. Applies even when max_timeout
                is None. Inherited by children (bounds grandchildren too). None
                (default) gives each child the full remaining budget.
            subcall_verifier: Strategy verifier reviewing every llm_query /
                rlm_query sub-call before it executes (see core/verifier.py).
                A veto returns "Strategy verifier rejected this call: <reason>"
                as the call's result instead of executing it. The same instance
                is shared with recursion children so resubmission memory and
                veto telemetry span the whole tree. None (default) disables
                review.
            subcall_extra_body: Request-body extras merged into every sub-call
                (llm_query / llm_query_batched / the max-depth rlm_query leaf
                fallback), e.g. {"chat_template_kwargs": {"enable_thinking":
                False}} to skip gemma's thought channel on mechanical calls.
                Root orchestrator calls are unaffected. Inherited by recursion
                children. Requires a backend whose completion() accepts
                extra_body (openai backend does). None (default) sends
                sub-calls unmodified.
            max_decode_tokens: Hard per-generation output ceiling applied to BOTH
                root and sub-calls as min(path-specific cap, this). Unlike
                root_max_tokens / subcall_max_tokens (default None = uncapped),
                this defaults ON (8192) so no caller - including SRLM candidate
                trajectories that omit the explicit caps - can run a single
                decode unbounded into the shared KV pool (rlm-trainer #7). Pass
                None to disable.
            root_max_tokens: Generation cap for ROOT orchestrator calls,
                including the forced final answer after iteration exhaustion.
                Bounds root-path runaway generations the way subcall_max_tokens
                bounds sub-calls. Set generously (real answers run a few
                thousand tokens). Inherited by recursion children. None
                (default) leaves root calls uncapped.
            soft_timeout_pct: If set (0 < pct < 1) together with max_timeout,
                inject a one-time wrap-up message once this fraction of
                max_timeout has elapsed, so the model answers from what it has
                gathered (or refuses) before the hard deadline 504s or its
                reasoning degenerates. Converts the slow tail into clean
                completions/refusals and caps tail latency. None (default) =
                off; no behavior change.
            soft_timeout_message: Override text for the wrap-up message
                (default _SOFT_BUDGET_MSG). Use a domain-specific wording, e.g.
                a librarian's exact no-coverage refusal sentence so a wrap-up on
                an uncovered question scores as a clean refusal.
            scheduler_max_concurrent: If set, create a priority RequestScheduler shared by all
                backend clients, capping in-flight requests and enabling context-contention
                retries at exclusive (p1) priority. Match this to the inference server's slot
                count (llama-server --parallel). None (default) disables scheduling.
            scheduler_aging_interval: Seconds of queue wait worth one priority level for
                p2-p5 requests (anti-starvation aging: an old "low" eventually outranks a
                fresh "high"). None disables aging. Only used when scheduler_max_concurrent
                is set. Default 30.0.
            scheduler_coordination_dir: If set (with scheduler_max_concurrent), directory of
                cross-process lock files extending contention-retry (p1) exclusivity across
                OS processes that target the same server. Opt-in; same host only. None
                (default) keeps coordination in-process.
