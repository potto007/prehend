"""prehend MemoryHarness: wrap an inference client with self-evolving experience memory.

This is the integration seam. It mirrors FinAcumen's ``MemoryAgentVariant``
(retrieve -> delegate solve -> collect) but delegates to anything exposing the
prehend ``completion(prompt, root_prompt)`` interface -- in practice an
:class:`~prehend.SRLM`. ``prompt`` is the context offloaded into the REPL;
``root_prompt`` is the question the orchestrator attends to directly, and where
the retrieved ``<Memory_Block>`` is injected.

Design invariants carried over from FinAcumen:
  * No-memory baseline integrity -- when retrieval is empty, ``root_prompt`` is
    byte-identical to the bare question; no memory tokens leak in.
  * Graceful degradation -- any retrieval failure falls back to no-memory; a
    single failure never crashes the solve.
  * Collect is best-effort -- a distillation failure never breaks the answer.
